# IBM Applied Data-Science Capstone SpaceX
# Introduction

In this capstone project, we aim to forecast the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing, a critical aspect of SpaceX's cost-competitive rocket launches. SpaceX's cost of $62 million per launch is significantly lower than other providers, which can cost upwards of $165 million, due in part to the ability to reuse the first stage. Accurately predicting the landing success would allow us to estimate the cost of a launch, providing valuable information for competing organizations seeking to bid against SpaceX.

As a data scientist working for a startup with ambitions to compete with SpaceX, you will gain hands-on experience with the data science methodology. You will collect, wrangle, analyze, visualize, model, evaluate, and present your findings to stakeholders as you work to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing.

# Business Problem

The cost of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches is significantly lower than that of other providers, with a cost of $62 million compared to upwards of $165 million for other providers. The ability to reuse the first stage is a major contributing factor to this cost savings. By accurately predicting the success of the first stage landing, we can determine the cost of a launch, which would provide valuable information for competing organizations looking to bid against SpaceX.

# Objective

* The objective of this project is to employ data science techniques and machine learning to accurately predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing and, as a result, determine the cost of a launch. Additionally, we aim to gain insights from the data through exploratory analysis.
